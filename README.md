## Deploy on Vite

Building the App
You may run npm run build command to build the app.

bash
```$ npm run build```
By default, the build output will be placed at dist. You may deploy this dist folder to any of your preferred platforms.

##Testing the App Locally
Once you've built the app, you may test it locally by running npm run preview command.

bash
$ npm run build
$ npm run preview
The vite preview command will boot up a local static web server that serves the files from dist at http://localhost:4173. It's an easy way to check if the production build looks OK in your local environment.

You may configure the port of the server by passing the --port flag as an argument.

```
json
{
  "scripts": {
    "preview": "vite preview --port 8080"
  }
}
```

Now the preview command will launch the server at 
```http://localhost:5173```.
